# Static Website Hosting on AWS S3

This project demonstrates deploying a static website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of hands-on cloud computing training.

The goal of this project was to understand how cloud storage, access control, and static website hosting work in AWS.

---

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

---

## Project Description
In this project, a static website was hosted on AWS S3. The website files (HTML and CSS) were uploaded to an S3 bucket, and static website hosting was enabled. Public access permissions were configured so the website could be accessed through a browser.

---

## Steps Performed

1. Created an S3 bucket with a globally unique name
2. Uploaded static website files (`index.html`, `style.css`)
3. Enabled static website hosting in S3 bucket properties
4. Configured bucket policy to allow public read access
5. Managed permissions using IAM concepts
6. Accessed the website using the S3 website endpoint

---

## Security Considerations
- Public access was enabled only for website hosting
- IAM concepts were followed to understand access control
- No access keys or sensitive credentials are shared in this repository

---

## Project Status
The AWS resources were later removed to avoid ongoing cloud charges.  
This repository serves as documentation of the deployment process and learning outcomes.

---

## Skills Gained
- Understanding of cloud storage using Amazon S3
- Static website deployment in AWS
- IAM basics and permission management
- Cloud security awareness
